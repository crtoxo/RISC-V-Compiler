## How much time did you spend on this project

14 hours.

## Project overview

The program will first construct a node tree. After that, the visitor object will traverse the tree from root to its childnodes by function "visit". When the visitor arrives a node, the program will print out the message of the node and the visitor will then visit the childnodes of that node.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

Showing the prototypes of function declaration, understanding the concepts of OOP and the structure of whole program.

## Feedback to T.A.s

Removing the quotation mark in the requirements is unnecessary.
