## How much time did you spend on this project

4 hours.

## Project overview

I refered to the context free grammar of "zero or more something" mentioned in the specification. Finally, I have generated the grammar followed by the rules of P language. The structure of this project includes the scanner, which keep detecting and sending tokens and parser, which checks if the token sequences follow ruled grammar or not.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

To eliminate the conflicts and find out the bugs. It's difficult to notice where the conflicts come from and I sometimes ignore some possibilities of few specific forms of grammar, for instance, "not expr".

## Feedback to T.A.s

List some more possible forms like I mentioned above.
