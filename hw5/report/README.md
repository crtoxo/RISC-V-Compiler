## 作業 5 心得

Homework 5 itself is not quite difficult, but it took me a lot of time to debug since is almost impossible to trace full assembly code. However, it is interesting to optimize several parts of code in order to minimize the code size and effort.


## 整學期編譯器作業心得

The series of homework gives me an overview of each part of compiler. In this course, I have not only learned complier design but also deeper concepts of object oriented programming, which is helpful to my programming skills.
I have taken a course which one of TAs in this course have also taken. She has applied AST in her final project of that course, which indicates that what I have in compiler can also be applied in other fields.
